### Overview

This document demonstrates the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in R using the `neuralnet` package. The Iris dataset is used for training and testing the models with different configurations of hidden layers. The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy.

### Installation of Packages

First, ensure the necessary packages are installed and loaded. This includes `neuralnet`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, and `tidyverse`.

###The ANN is built with varying configurations of hidden layers to evaluate performance:

Model 1: Two hidden layers 
Model 2: Three hidden layers 
Model 3: 5 hidden layers
